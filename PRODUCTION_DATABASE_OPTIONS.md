# Production Database Solutions

## Current Issue: SQLite in Serverless
- ❌ Read-only filesystem prevents SQLite writes
- ❌ No data persistence between function calls  
- ❌ Cold start performance penalty
- ❌ Large bundle size (database + 2,055 workflow files)

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Static JSON API (Immediate Fix)
**Best for read-only workflow documentation**
```javascript
// Pre-build all data as JSON files during build
npm run build:json  // Generate static JSON files
```
- ✅ Works with Netlify serverless immediately
- ✅ Fast performance (direct file serving)
- ✅ No database dependencies
- ✅ Perfect for documentation sites

### Option 2: Netlify Edge Functions + KV Store
**For dynamic features**
```javascript
// Use Netlify's key-value store
const workflows = await env.WORKFLOWS_KV.get('all-workflows');
```
- ✅ Built for Netlify
- ✅ Global edge distribution
- ✅ Supports read/write operations
- ⚠️ Requires data migration

### Option 3: External Database Service
**For full application features**
- **PlanetScale** (MySQL): Free tier, serverless
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL): Free tier, full-text search
- **FaunaDB**: Serverless-first database
- ✅ Proper database with ACID guarantees
- ✅ Handles concurrent access
- ⚠️ Requires API keys and setup

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach
**Static site + external API for search**
- Static files for browsing workflows
- External search API for complex queries
- ✅ Best performance for viewing
- ✅ Rich search when needed

## Immediate Recommendation

**Switch to static JSON generation** for this use case:

1. Pre-build all API responses as JSON files
2. Serve directly from Netlify CDN
3. Keep full-text search as client-side with lunr.js or similar
4. Perfect for documentation/browsing workflows

This eliminates all serverless database issues while maintaining functionality.
